AUTHOR
    This is originally the work of Ariel Brosh, a member of Israel.pm and
    author of several contributions to CPAN. He has unfortunately passed
    away and have left behind several Perl modules where this is just one of
    them.

    I volunteered to contribute further to the development of the modules,
    but it is still kept under the name of Ariel Brosh - the original
    author.
