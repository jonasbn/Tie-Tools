=head1 AUTHOR

This is originally the work of Ariel Brosh, a member of Israel.pm and
author of several contributions to CPAN. He has unfortunately passed
away and have left behind several Perl modules where this is just one
of them.

I volunteered to contribute further to the development of the modules,
but it is still kept under the name of Ariel Brosh - the original
author.
