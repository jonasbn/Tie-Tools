From the original readme file

I still have to document these classes.
They are essential for HTML::HTPL but have their own use.

TODO

- Fix test.pl, it can still be tricky to use, since it used the
  installed version and not the one you are currently building when called
  like this:

  % perl test.pl

  When you just 'make test' there are no problems

- Change build system to Module::Build

- Write more POD
